# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the `turtle` module in Python.

## How to Play
1. Run the `snake_game.py` script.
2. Control the snake using the arrow keys: Up, Down, Left, and Right.
3. Eat the food represented by a green square to grow longer.
4. Avoid colliding with the boundaries or yourself, as it will end the game.
5. Try to achieve the highest score by eating as much food as possible.
